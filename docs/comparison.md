# How this core compares

Other Sharp MZ implementations, as of 2026-10-02. "v2" is the original author's tranZPUter SW-700 emuMZ RTL (`refs/tranZPUter`, the
base of this port); NibblesLab's are the Terasic DE0 cores (github.com/NibblesLab); mz800emu is Michal Hucik's emulator, our reference
for the MZ-700/800/1500; MAME is 0.264 with its own driver status flags. Sources: our own surveys of each (TODO.md history).

## Where this core is ahead

- The only FPGA core with the MZ-1500 (PCG and Quick Disk), and the only FPGA core with Quick Disk.
- MZ-800 graphics checked frame by frame against mz800emu; 8 bugs fixed in the VideoController code taken from v2.
- MZ-80B/2000 tape and floppy work through their IPLs (v2's MZ-80B video was marked untested; MAME's drivers are preliminary).
- A standard MiSTer core: MGL files can load tapes and disks, and the sim and hardware suites run unattended.

## Where others are ahead

- v2: higher turbo, four floppy drives, floppy on every model including the MZ-80K/80A.
- mz800emu: Quick Disk writing, joysticks, printer, RAM disk boards.
- MAME: the MZ-2500 (imperfect), and WAV tape input.
